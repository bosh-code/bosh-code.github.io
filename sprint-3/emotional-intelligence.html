                <section id="iq-vs-eq"><h3>IQ vs EQ</h3>
                    <p>IQ is a well known, although flawed measure of intelligence. It's well known and the term is
                        often used, however the meaning of the abbreviation is not. EQ is even less known, so what do
                        they actually mean?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>IQ is an abbreviation for “Intelligence Quotient” and is supposed to be a measure of
                            someone's "relative intelligence".
                        </li>
                        <li>EQ, likewise, is "Emotional Quotient" (sometimes referred to as EI) and is someone's ability
                            to identify and manage their
                            own or another's emotions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>According to some <a href="https://www.123test.com/">online IQ test</a>, I have an IQ of <em>"125
                        or higher"</em> what this really means is <em>absolutely nothing</em>
                        <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/nov/29/iq-tests-online-are-they-valid">
                            <em><strong>no one</strong> should take these seriously</em></a>.</p>

                    <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is stated by <a
                            href="https://www.mindtools.com/community/BookInsights/EmotionalIntelligence.php">Daniel
                        Goleman</a> as containing 5 distinct elements:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Self-awareness</li>
                        <li>Self-regulation</li>
                        <li>Motivation</li>
                        <li>Empathy</li>
                        <li>Social Skills</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Breaking these down further, we can see how each skills affects our overall EQ:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="my-2"><strong>Self-awareness</strong> is one's own ability to identify and
                            acknowledge one's own feelings and emotions and understand how these emotions and
                            actions can affect those around. You understand your own strengths and weaknesses and
                            how to be humble.
                        </li>
                        <li class="my-2"><strong>Self-regulation</strong> is to have control over one's own actions.
                            Having good self-regulation means one is not likely to lash out, make poorly influenced
                            decisions, compromise values. Those with strong self-regulation are able to stay in
                            control.
                        </li>
                        <li class="my-2"><strong>Motivation</strong> is important to consistent work towards
                            fulfilling goals. To achieve to a high standard, it's required to stay highly motivated.
                        </li>
                        <li class="my-2"><strong>Empathy</strong> helps someone understand the way another feels,
                            how they are motivated, anything else that may be happening. Empathy can tie in a lot to
                            self-awareness & self-regulation. Those with strong empathy skills can understand
                            someone through body-language and their responses.
                        </li>
                        <li class="my-2"><strong>Social skills</strong> can be a very important tool in working with
                            others. Conflict resolution is an important skill needed when working with others and is
                            directly influenced by communication skills. Social skills also include understanding
                            queues, giving and receiving feedback or praise and being approachable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Why EQ is so important now</h3>
                    <p>While EQ was not a term coined until 1990, it's a set of skills practiced since people began
                        working in groups.
                        By now you should have a good understanding of why EQ is important in perceiving, processing and
                        regulating emotional information, but
                        <strong>why are these skills important?</strong></p>
                    <p>Understanding and practicing good EQ provides a framework for interaction in which we make them
                        more rewarding, supportive and healthy for everyone involved.
                        We are not solitary beings, whether you like it or not, you are required to interact with others
                        in various settings and practicing good EQ can improve these situations for you and the other
                        participants.
