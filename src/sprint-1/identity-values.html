                <p>My names Ryan, I'm <span id="age"></span> years old from Auckland, New Zealand ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ I've
                    recently
                    graduated with my bachelors degree in Computer Science from AUT, before continuing

                    <p>The middle child of 3 sons, I was born and raised in New Zealand, mostly Auckland. My
                        Father has
                        always worked in Technology and it has always been my largest passion in life. After school,
                        I've worked in the technology industry and recently completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer
                        Science. While at uni I was fortunate enough to spend 6 weeks in Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ for a
                        scholarship.

                    <p>I like to see those around me succeed, I never put personal gain above those I care about.
                        I try to encourage and help wherever possible. I try to be empathetic & compassion.</p>

                    <h3>An Ethical Decision</h3>
                    <p>While working for an MSP in Auckland, I was constantly facing decisions around "doing the
                        right
                        thing". Labor costs are not cheap and as a contractor for clients, my time could be a huge
                        bill. Clients would often want temporary fixes or the cheapest solution possible, which often
                        meant
                        I would need to be back again soon when the wheels inevitably fell off. Often times I really
                        felt for the clients, IT is was not something they knew a lot about, just that it was
                        expensive and a pain when it didn't work.<br>Some clients were really kind and I knew their
                        financial situations weren't great, so when they requested stop-gap solutions to issues, I
                        tried to do the right thing for them. I would spend un-billable time for them after-hours,
                        either on-site or remotely when it was needed. They wouldn't be able to pay for the time anyway
                        and everyone needs IT to do their jobs, so it always seemed the ethical thing to do.

                    <h3>Culture</h3>
                    <p>Being raised in New Zealand I feel that the NZ culture has shaped who I am and my outlook.
                        I try to be an open-minded person and give anything a go. Also to try not judge others and be
                        respectful in my interactions. I try to be a problem solver, and think outside the box, which
                        is very "New Zealand". Experiences and interactions have shaped my culture and I believe there
                        is
                        always something you can take with you from them.</p>

                    <h3>Strengths</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am very relaxed and easy going, I find I can get along with anyone.</li>
                        <li>I have strong communication skills and love to hear all sides.</li>
                        <li>Teamwork is the best way to work in my book.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Playing to my Strengths</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With how varied and dynamic this work is, my strengths will be a big help.
                            I am great in a team and can hopefully assist when it's needed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Strong communication is always important in team work and it will come in handy when working
                            in person and remotely.
                        </li>

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I can struggle to make decisions, often preferring someone else to. If I can effectively
                            communicate this to my peers when doing group work, this should be easy to overcome by
                            letting someone else make a decision if I can't.
                        </li>
                        <li>I can find it difficult to focus on tasks, especially those I do not find rewarding. I can
                            use timeboxing and give myself an extra long break to encourage myself to get something
                            done. Also planning the boring tasks first, so I can get them out of the way and do cool
                            ones.
                        </li>
