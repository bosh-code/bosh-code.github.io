                    <p>My long term goal currently is to be a full-stack Web developer within the next 5 years.
                        Thinking more short-term, after completing EDA, I would like to use my bachelors and EDA
                        experience to get a junior developer role.</p>

                    <p>From experience and personal strengths I know that I learn better in person, in a group and
                        doing
                        practical experience. However there is a lot of learning that goes on doesn't fit into this
                        model,
                        so I need to make sure I can work on effectively working on my own and remotely.</p>

                    <h3>Workload Management</h3>
                    <p>Self management will be important for me going forwards. Throughout uni, most of my time
                        was
                        self managed and initially I struggled with it. However I learnt to cope with the workload by
                        using
                        a few key skills, such as;</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Smart goals</strong> or "<a
                                href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm">smarter goals</a>" helped
                            me to break tasks down into
                            smaller chunks
                            that coule be completed in a clear, individual and time-based way.<em> Smarter goals</em>
                            must contain the following criteria.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>S</strong>pecific</li>
                                <li><strong>M</strong>easurable</li>
                                <li><strong>A</strong>chievable</li>
                                <li><strong>R</strong>elevant</li>
                                <li><strong>T</strong>ime bound</li>
                                <li><strong>E</strong>valuated</li>
                                <li><strong>R</strong>eviewed</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Time-boxing</strong> was used with Smart goals in the time-bound criterion.
                            I often found myself using "<a

                        </li>
                        <li>I also found myself often using a combination of mostly 45-15 work to break boxes and
                            15/20-5 depending on the task
                        </li>

                    <h3>Scheduling</h3>
                    <p>&ensp;Usually I take a looser approach to scheduling and I find it works best for me. Days are
                        scheduled for certain smart goals, based on work that needs to be done.
                        I don't rigorously plan out a days activities ahead of time, just the smart goal or goals for
                        the day so I have an idea of my desired achievable(s). During the day, at the start of each
                        goal, I will box out times based on how long I think I need.
                        I find this method of planning to be similar to agile in it's cycle of planning, doing then
                        reviewing and it helps me to stay on task and focused.<br>I try to work around my partner's
                        work times, so we have time together in the evenings, also I usually spend a couple of hours
                        each day on the weekend working.</p>

                        handbook or if a similar question has been posted in a communications channel.
                        After that, my facilitator is my next point of contact and I can rely on them to point me in the
                        right direction.</p>
