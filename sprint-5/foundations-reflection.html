                <p>A summary of my time in Foundations</p>

                <section id="3-things">
                    <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core
                        learning?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I really try not to ask for help, often when it could save me some time and hassle.</li>
                        <li>I like Javascript a lot more than I thought I would.</li>
                        <li>I can get too in the weeds on small issues and forget the bigger picture.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section id="roles">
                    <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
                    <p>It's about not forgetting that developers and users and clients are people too and that we are
                        writing software for people. We should be reasonable, and not loose sight of who we are and what
                        we do.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="surprised">
                    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
                    <p>How much I like Javascript. All my prior experiences were with strictly typed <em>compiled</em>
                        languages. Javascript and it's interpretation were always yucky to me.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="challenging">
                    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
                    <p>In General: Neuroplasticity and using a growth mindset was a challenge for me.</p>
                    <p>For tech: Making CSS look good, as well as resize. Minesweeper and some of the stretch JS
                        too.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="learning">
                    <h4> Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning
                        in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
                    <p>Because we are here to learn a lot of challenging things, very quickly, doesn't matter what we
                        are learning. We need to make the most of our time and that includes good routine, foundation
                        and abilities to lean.</p>
                </section>
                <section id="justify>">
                    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
                        just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer</h4>
                    <p>No I don't think so. I had done a lot of the core learning before but it was great to go back
                        over it.</p>
