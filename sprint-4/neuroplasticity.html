                    <h3>Understanding</h3>
                    <p>Neuroplasticity is a general term for some complex things that happen in the brain. It's the
                        ability of our neural networks to change, like neural pathways making new connections. For
                        example, neuroplasticity changes can occur from some of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Learning new things and abilities</li>
                        <li>Environmental and external influences</li>
                        <li>Practicing a skill or task</li>
                        <li>Stress</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our brains remain <em>"plastic"</em> well into adulthood, meaning our ability to learn and
                        practice is not lost as a child. A lot of research has been conducted into what learning is and
                        how we learn, as well as ways to maximise our neuroplasticity. You can read more about that <a

                <section id="growth-mindset">
                    <h3>The growth mindset</h3>
                    <p>A growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset. In a fixed mindset, we believe that our
                        character, intelligence and creative abilities are fixed or <em>static</em>, and that we are
                        unable to change them in a meaningful way. Success is therefore confirming our bias that
                        intelligence is inherent, which can lead to an avoidance if risk taking and failure.</p>
                    <p>Practicing a growth mindset creates a passion for learning, confidence to take risks and
                        understanding that failure is not a negative experience, it is learning and another step towards
                        achievement.</p>
                    <p>The characteristics of a growth mindset can be summed up in a few key points:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A desire to learn</li>
                        <li>Persistence during setbacks</li>
                        <li>Knowing mastery comes from effort</li>
                        <li>Learning from criticism</li>
                        <li>Learning and being inspired by others</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An example of growth vs fixed mindset is children completing a jigsaw puzzle. Children who prefer
                        to repeat previously completed "easy" puzzles, are practicing a fixed mindset, whereas those
                        who chose a new more difficult puzzle were of a growth mindset. Their definition of success was
                        different, those with the fixed was just about completing puzzles, however, those with growth,
                        were about learning.</p>

                    <h3>The influence on learning</h3>
                    <p>To increase neuroplasticity for a positive effect on learning, I'm trying to break up some of my
                        daily routine, introducing novel and different tasks to establish new pathways. I'm also trying
                        to get more exercise into my day, but that can be a challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p>To practice a good growth mindset and incorporate it into my learning plan, I'm taking more time
                        during my reflections, thinking about what was challenging during my sprint and why I found it
                        challenging.</p>
