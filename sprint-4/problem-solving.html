                    <h3>Getting blocked</h3>
                    <p>I've written the Fizzbuzz code a few times, it's usually what I use after writing Hello world for
                        each language. Everytime there is a roadblock, as languages are different. I know the
                        logic well, however language syntax and environments can trip me up early on. With
                        <a href="/sprint-4/fizzbuzz.html">Fizzbuzz</a>, I
                        wanted to update a printout of the result of running the code on my HTML page. That's simple DOM
                        manipulation and something I had just been practicing, so I felt confident.</p>
                    <p>However, after
                        initially testing it, I found that my result printout was being appended to the existing text in
                        the element. I rubber ducked the javascript I had wrote to isolate where I believed the issue
                        was, then looked for a solution. I was able to use terms and keywords I had learnt to
                        effectively search StackOverflow for an answer and example, that I as able to re-write,
                        changing it to fit my use case.
                    </p>
                    <p>The code that solved my problem is this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript rounded-5rem">function fizzbuzz (num) {
  document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = '' // clear the paragraph first
...</code></pre>
                    <pre><code class="language-javascript rounded-5rem">function append (textToAppend) {
  let paragraph = document.getElementById('result') // get the paragraph
  let text = document.createTextNode('// ' + textToAppend) // get the text to append to the paragraph
  let linebreak = document.createElement('br') // create a linebreak to append
  paragraph.appendChild(text) // append text
  paragraph.appendChild(linebreak) // append linebreak
}</code></pre>

                <section id="elegant-solution">
                    <h3>An elegant solution</h3>
                    <p>I was trying to get darkmode working correctly for this blog. Since it uses Bootstrap and custom
                        CSS, to create a dark version was more work than I was willing to put in for a small quality of
                        life feature. As it was something I didn't know where to start, I googled around and found a few
                        solutions, either using pure CSS or Javascript/PHP with cookies. I tried using the more complex
                        options, however they would introduce bugs or strange visual artifacts of switching between
                        light and dark.</p>
                    <p>Eventually I rolled back my branch, and implemented two stylesheets, one light and one dark which
                        I generated online. The dark sheet makes use of <code>@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)</code>
                        which will take the user's device preference and apply the sheet accordingly. There is no manual
                        way to switch between them, but all devices that support the feature now automatically toggle
                        the theme. I found this solution elegant as it uses one line of code, happens behind the scenes
                        and was very quick to implement. I could see myself spending far too long on the feature due to
                        my limited skills and this is a good trade-off in my opinion.

                    <h3>Problem solving techniques</h3>
                    <p>All of the techniques are something I have used in the past in some form. Having experience with
                        them, I know how I like to and when to use them.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong> - is something I use when dealing with larger or more complex
                            problems. I write it before hand, either the class, file or block of logic.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Trying something</strong> - never hurts. Sometimes the really easy and obvious
                            solution is the write one. Sometimes I get a little stuck in trying things, so I try to use
                            it sparingly.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong> - I often use it when running through logic or method
                            calls that aren't working, especially if I can't use a debugger.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong> - has been less useful in Javascript as I don't know
                            many of the error messages yet. With languages I'm more familiar with, it's a lot quicker.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Console.logging</strong> - I use it a lot for sanity checking logic quickly, can be
                            a quick way to ensure something has happened correctly without breakpoints and the debugger.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Googling</strong> - is the first step in looking for solutions external. When I've
                            tried to work it out on my own and can't find a solution, google is the next step.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong> - the next step after googling, if I can't find
                            a solution or understand the one I find, I'll ask my peers. I always prefer it when someone
                            tries something themself first before asking for help, so I try to do the same.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong> - would be the last step in external help, if my
                            peers can't help, either I'm doing something wrong and there's a better way they know, or
                            it's not as simple as I think.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong> - is very important. Once I'm
                            completed the problem, I'll try to do a couple practice methods and use it to incorporate
                            the knowledge.
                        </li>
