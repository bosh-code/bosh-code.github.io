        <h4>Me & my core personal values</h4>
        <p>&emsp;I believe that I am an honest and loyal person. To give an example, a friend an I were working on a uni
            project together, we differed on how to approach the problem and could not come to an agreement. I honestly
            thought my solution was better, and he his, so we could not come to an agreement. I expressed why I felt my
            solution was better, however he was adamant on his approach. We went with his approach, and even though I
            did not agree it was the best way to tackle the problem, I give it my best and worked through the solution
            the same as
            any other.</p>
        <p>&emsp;I could have taken charge, or been dismissive, however I felt the ethical thing to do was complete the
            solution his way. He cared more than I did about solving the problem his way than I did about mine.</p>

        <h4>My strengths & limitations</h4>
        <p>&emsp;<em>Limitations:</em> I can be very easily distracted and often focus too much time and energy on simple or more rewarding tasks, rather than priorities.</p>
